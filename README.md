# spectral-clustering-demo

A fun review of spectral clustering with MATLAB demos I made for the NU machine learning meetiup in 2014.  A nice pdf writeup on spectral clustering summarizes the motivation and math behind spectral clustering, and the associated MATLAB demos reproduce many of the figures shown there.
